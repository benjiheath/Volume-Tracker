## Volume Tracker

Small project to become more familiar with React. Tracks total volume (reps\*weight) for exercises between workouts for monitoring improvements.
This is easily done in a spreadsheet but I thought it would be good practice to code it from scratch.

\***\*todo\*\***

- Fix graph display

- Allow user to use different weights for each set

- implement search/select for exercise name input

- Improve layout when there are >2-3 exercises

- add responsiveness

- focus weight input field when user adds new session

- Improve naming & refactor

- clean up the pigsty that is my stylesheet
