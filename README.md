## Volume Tracker

This is a small fun project to continue practicing React basics. Here I attempt to replicate a simple spreadsheet that I would use to track total volume (reps\*weight) for gym exercises, allowing me to monitor strength improvements.



[Demo here](https://goofy-shaw-3167b1.netlify.app/)

#### How to use
Intended to be used like a pre-configured spreadsheet.

1. Name your exercise (e.g 'Squat', 'Bench press' etc)
2. Specify weight used for each workout/session
3. Specify reps completed for each set
4. Add sets & sessions to your exercise as required

Total volume comparisons (absolute and percentage) are made for all sessions after session 1

*Currently unfinished as I've moved on to continue learning.*





<h4>**todo**</h4>

- Allow user to use different weights for each set

- implement search/select for exercise name input

- Improve layout when there are >2-3 exercises

- reconfigure layout for mobile devices

- focus weight input field when user adds new session

- Improve naming & refactor

- clean up stylesheet
